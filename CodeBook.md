###Naming Convention     

**Prefix**

t -> Time Domain

f -> Frequency Domain

###Samples

Sampling Frequency of 50Hz was used with a time window of 2.56 second which resulted in 128 samples. The mean and standard deviation of these samples were taken

###Components

**Acceleration**

Linear acceleration was measured using accelorometer. Two components of acceleration are

-Body

-Gravity
 
**Angular Velocity**
 
Angular velocity was measured using  gyro and it has only body component.
